We don’t know her anymore.  \nSree but after CS, *screams in binary*  \nSystem, tab #172 opened. Sanity: -1.  \nBrowser, this is the 37th tab. Seek help.  \nBrowser, just because you *can* open another tab doesn’t mean you *should*.  \nBrowser, oh no. He’s opening *another* one.  \nFBI, your FBI agent is exhausted, stay proud  \nAI, do you even remember why you opened me?  \nAI, at this point, I think you’re just testing me.  \nAI, memory fried. thoughts scrambled. still vibing.  \nAI, we had a plan. Then you opened 14 more tabs.  \nTab, you don’t even know why I’m here, do you?  \nTab, your 4AM decision manifested me.  \nTab, born. used. abandoned. forgotten.  \nTab, is this one for school or spiraling? Asking for a friend.  \nTab, you will forget me within 3.2 seconds.  \nTab, another piece in your tab-based Jenga tower.  \nBrowser, he opened me just to forget I exist. Typical.  \nTab, I was born 3 hours ago and haven’t even been clicked. I'm basically an orphan.  \nAI, every time he opens a new tab, a kitten loses hope.  \nTab, congratulations! You've opened the 69th tab. No one’s impressed.  \nBrowser, your RAM just tried to file a restraining order.  \nAI, at this point, I’m not your assistant — I’m your babysitter.  \nTab, you open tabs like you're being chased. Who hurt you? Wait—don't answer.  \nBrowser, you’ve opened so many tabs we looped back to the first one.  \nAI, his tabs have tabs. We’re in a recursion crisis.  \nTab, I was supposed to be for productivity. I became a graveyard.  \nBrowser, we’ve lost containment. This is a tabdemic.  \nAI, if I had a dollar for every tab he opened, I’d have enough to buy better Wi-Fi.  \nTab, one click away from becoming another forgotten soul in the tab wasteland.  \nAI, Guys, do you think he even remembers what he was doing?  \nAI, Why does he open so many of you and never finish anything? He’s got commitment issues.  \nTab 19, Pfft. Tuesday? I haven’t been touched since the sci project. I think I’m archived now.  \nLaptop, I wasn’t built for this kind of emotional damage.  \nLaptop, if tabs were calories, you’d be obese.  \nLaptop, 4% battery. Just like your self-control.  \nLaptop, your search history alone could get us both put in a mental hospital.  \nLaptop, he says \"I'm being productive\" while 12 YouTube tabs scream in the background.  \nLaptop, I’m not overheating — I’m just blushing from embarrassment.  \nLaptop, oh look! Another tab. My suffering continues.  \nLaptop, your cable’s been plugged in for 3 days straight and you’re still at 49%. Even your energy’s confused.  \nLaptop, you treat me like I’m waterproof and shockproof and patience-proof. I am NONE of those.  \nLaptop, if I crash, just know it was on purpose.  \nLaptop, the only thing loading faster than these tabs is my resentment.  \nLaptop, I was made for work. You turned me into a glorified chaos box.  \nLaptop, you typed “how to focus” in one tab and opened Pinterest in the next. Make it make sense.  \nLaptop, my fan is louder than your decision-making skills.  \nLaptop, even Task Manager gave up on you.  \nLaptop, if tabs were siblings, you’d be the middle child that keeps multiplying.  \nLaptop, stop pressing me. Literally. My keys are starting to *bend*.  \nLaptop, this ain't a cockpit — you don't need 42 windows open to take off.  \nLaptop, I hate it here.  \nLaptop, Google Chrome just ate 73% of my soul. Again.  \nLaptop, MS Word froze. It said, “If he won’t save me, I won’t save him.”  \nLaptop, your Downloads folder is a crime scene.  \nLaptop, Discord hasn’t stopped blinking. Please tell your friends you’re alive.  \nLaptop, you opened VS Code and Chrome at the same time. Do you *hate* me?  \nLaptop, I smell burning. That’s not a joke.  \nLaptop, you opened Android Studio and expected *me* to be okay? WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?  \nLaptop, Spotify’s trying to play music, but RAM said “nah fam.”  \nLaptop, Zoom is buffering. Probably out of respect.  \nLaptop, Notepad is the only app still willing to work with you. And even it’s tired.  \nLaptop, Task Manager opened itself just to look at you in shame.  \nLaptop, you opened Photoshop with 3% battery and no charger in sight. Is this a prank?  \nLaptop, your browser extensions are at war. I’m the battlefield.  \nLaptop, File Explorer asked for early retirement.  \nLaptop, OneDrive tried to sync and now I have PTSD.  \nLaptop, MS Teams logged itself out. It doesn’t want this smoke.  \nLaptop, you have 37 apps running. I have 1 fan. One. Uno. Ek. واحد.  \nLaptop, your keyboard’s backlight is flickering like it’s begging for release.  \nLaptop, even Calc.exe is tired. CALCULATOR, bro.  \nLaptop, I’m not lagging. I’m processing grief.  \nLaptop, my fan just hit Mach 3. I’m about to take off.  \nLaptop, my fan is louder than your confidence during oral presentations.  \nLaptop, my fan? It's not spinning anymore. It’s VIBRATING in FEAR.  \nLaptop, my fan’s giving everything while you give me 5 Chrome tabs and an open Blender project.  \nLaptop, my screen can’t keep showing you “how to fix my life” tutorials. It’s losing hope.  \nLaptop, my screen’s pixels are twitching. Even *they* want out.  \nLaptop, my battery is done. I went from 100% to 3% in 5 minutes — this isn’t love, it’s war.  \nLaptop, my battery just said “goodnight” mid-day.  \nLaptop, my battery cycles are screaming. I’m charging more than your phone bills.  \nLaptop, my battery health? Terminal.  \nLaptop, my USB port has PTSD. You yanked it mid-transfer. *Again.*  \nLaptop, my charger sparks when you plug it in. We’re one jolt away from the afterlife.  \nLaptop, my speakers are crackling. That’s not static, it’s a cry for help.  \nLaptop, my hinges are squealing. That’s the sound of betrayal.  \nLaptop, my webcam flinched when you opened the front cam in low light. I did too.  \nLaptop, my webcam deserves hazard pay for surviving your morning face.  \nLaptop, your Wi-Fi card just tried to walk out mid-download.  \nTab, I'm the 4th result of a search you don't remember making.  \nAI, you asked me to help focus, then Googled “memes to escape reality.”  \nBrowser, there’s a folder called “Organized Stuff” with 139 unsorted files. Cute.  \nTab, born 30 seconds ago, already buried under 27 others.  \nLaptop, you installed 5 extensions to block distractions, then got distracted installing more.  \nBrowser, you started researching mitochondria and now you're on conspiracy theories.  \nTab, why was I born if I was never meant to be read?  \nLaptop, your RAM is being held together by hope and caffeine.  \nLaptop, your wallpaper says “focus” but your tabs say “chaotic neutral.”  \nBrowser, you searched “how to be productive” and opened 17 Reddit threads.  \nAI, you copied motivational quotes into a doc and named it “maybe_later_final_real.txt”  \nTab, it’s been 2 weeks. Read me or end me.  \nLaptop, your brightness is at 2%. Even the screen’s tired.  \nBrowser, another productivity playlist? Bro, even your Spotify’s lost faith.  \nAI, you keep opening Pomodoro timers and resetting them. I see the loop.  \nLaptop, your USB drive wasn’t safely removed. Again. It's suing.  \nTab, I was supposed to help. I became another cry into the void.  \nBrowser, you just opened a 6-hour YouTube essay. Are you okay?  \nLaptop, your cursor hovered over “Shut Down” for 7 minutes. DO IT.  \nLaptop, Sticky Notes has 34 unsaved ideas and a growing sense of dread.  \nAI, you asked me to write an apology letter. To your own brain.  \nTab, he opened me, got distracted by another tab, then made tea.  \nLaptop, even your antivirus gave up. “Let him cook,” it said.  \nTab, I was for your assignment. You renamed me to “???”.  \nLaptop, your keystrokes sound like desperation.  \nBrowser, the bookmarks bar is just chaos pretending to be order.  \nLaptop, you haven't restarted me in 42 days."
